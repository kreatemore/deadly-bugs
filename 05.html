      <div class="header">What?</div>
      We could reset any user's password with a similar email address.
      <br>
      There are two flaws that allows us to do so:
      <br>
      1. We convert UTF-8 chars to ASCII. We might be doing this out of fear of the unknown
      <br>
      2. We aren't using the email address stored in the db, but the one that was supplied.
      It should be fine, since they're equal, so it doesn't matter which one, right?
      <br>
      <br>
      dÃ©vice@horsefucker.org will be
      converted to device@horsefucker.org. This will find the user in the db,
      even though the email address isn't the same. Since the code thinks the user
      has the same email, it'll happily send a new password, but it will send it
      to our address.

      <div class="header">How to prevent?</div>
      The easiest solution here would be to use the email coming from the db.
      You could still trigger a reset email, but the only thing that would do
      is to alert the person you're trying to hack.
